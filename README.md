I got one of these (the model with a USB connector) for a dollar on eBay, rather than doing gists or repo for each project I figure I'll just dump them all into the one location (if I ever think of any more)

Connected using tutorial from http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting

Have had issues connecting directly into my macbook so I will document any hardware hacks I come up with there (will probably try filing some of the chip away). Currently using an extension cable.
